# PSU Dummy Load eXPerience
A series of simple experiences on build dummy loads to test small PSU.<br>
The type of load leads to classifying this kind of devices as follows:

- Passive resistive load
- Active electronics load

Within the previous cassifications, it is possible to determine some basic features:

- Constant Current load
- Constant Voltage load
- Constant Resistance load
- Constant Power load
